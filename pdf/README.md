## Useful PDF files

These files provide some basic information about the HSA console.

It might appear that 1.1 and 1.2 are missing, 
but 1.1 is the syllabus for the UFA school which rewrote HSA and 1.2 is very simple Java basics.

*These files need updating to incorporate new changes made by J.Gray and M.Harwood.* (How does one edit a PDF?)

In spite of this, they are useful to get started with. 
Javadoc for the HSA2 files will be generated in a week or two and uploaded also.
