Version 3.1:
	Added sleep(long time) to Console.java so that students don't have to catch or throw InterruptedExceptions
	Changing Console.java to GraphicsConsole.java
	
Version 3:
	AntiAliasing and strokes added.
	Package name changed from HSA_UFA to HSA2 
		(which is more concise, less unweildy, and means that we don't need to keep adding on institutions who improve it)
	Finished adding comments for JavaDoc (some were already there).
