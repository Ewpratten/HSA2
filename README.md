# HSA2

## Holt Software Associates simple graphics for Java &mdash; updated for Java 7 and Java 8.

*The intent of this software is to allow new Java programmers to start using graphics without having to learn Swing first.*

### The PDF files contain useful documentation.
At some point I may update them to reflect the changes and additions that I've made. Some sample code might also be useful.

> Limitations:
> * All keyboard input is handled through the Swing KeyListener. 
> * There is no error handling for text input: the program displays a message and then ends immediately.
> * There is some flickering still with animated images. 
These limitations will not be fixed. The solution is to begin programming in Swing or JavaFX.
