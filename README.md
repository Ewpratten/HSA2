# HSA2

## HSA simple graphics for Java 7 and Java 8.

*The intent of this software is to allow new Java programmers to start using graphics without having to learn Swing first.*

> Limitations: all keyboard input is handled through the Swing KeyListener. There is no error handling for text input: the program displays a message and then ends immediately.
